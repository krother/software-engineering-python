# Python Software Development

### What this guide is about?

This guide is for you if you are writing programs with more than 500 lines.

You know how to write Python code, but have realized that creating a piece of software is more complex. You are facing questions like:

* How to clean up my code?
* How to make sure my program works?
* How to install my program on multiple computers?
* How to keep the program running over time?
* How to deliver the program to other people?

Below you find development tools and techniques that help you to write programs that get the job done and don't fall apart.
