# Continuous Integration

In this exercise you will create a simple **continuous integration** workflow.

## What does CI do?

When anyone pushes to the GitHub repository, GitHub should:

1. create an empty virtual computer
2. clone the repository
3. install all dependencies
4. run automated tests
5. report whether the tests succeed or fail

## Step 1: Preparations

You need:

* a GitHub repo for your project
* a `requirements.txt` file
* at least one automated test

## Step 2: Create a workflow

GitHub Actions needs instructions how to install the program.

Create a folder `.github/workflows/`. 
Place a text file `check.yml` into that folder containing the following:

    name: run_tests
    
    on:
      push:
        branches: [ main ]
    
    jobs:
      build:
    
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
        steps:
        - uses: actions/checkout@v2
        - name: Set up Python 3.9
          uses: actions/setup-python@v2
          with:
            python-version: 3.9
        - name: Install dependencies
          run: |
            python -m pip install --upgrade pip
            pip install -r requirements.txt
        - name: Test with pytest
          run: |
            pytest

Adjust the Python version to match yours.

## Step 3: Requirements

A best practice is to have a separate file for **development requirements**.

* Create a separate file `dev_requirements.txt`
* Add pytest to it
* Add a **pip install** line to the yml file.

## Step 4: Push

Commit and push the changes.

## Step 5: Observe

* Go to GitHub. Check the **Actions** tab.
* Watch the output of your project building.
* Also check your mailbox.

## Step 6: Badge

Copy the following code into your `README.md` file:

    ![Python application](https://github.com/USER/REPO/workflows/run_tests/badge.svg)

Replace **USER** and **REPO** by the data of your project.
**run_tests** is the name from the workflow file.

You should see a red or green badge in the README that updates itself.
