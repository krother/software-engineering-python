# Debugging

Debugging your code is a skill of its own. Here is a list of debugging techniques that you might want to try:

## Easy Bugs

* read the code
* read the error message
* inspect variables with `print(x)`
* inspect the type of variables with `print(type(x))`

## Difficult Bugs

* take a break
* reproduce the bug
* reproduce the bug with minimal input data
* drop assertions in your code
* clean up your code
* write more tests
* explain the problem to someone else
* step through the code in an interactive debugger
* google the error message

## Very Difficult Bugs

* sleep over it
* ask for a code review
* write down what the problem is
* draw a formal description of your program logic (flowchart, state diagram
* draw a formal description of your data structure (class diagram, ER-diagram)
* background reading on the library / algorithm you are implementing
