# Editors

**The editor is the main tool of a programmer. Learn to use one of them well.**

Here we list the most common Python editors.

| editor | description   |
|--------|---------------|
| VS Code | powerful editor with many plugins, maintained by Microsoft |
| PyCharm | lots of functionality for writing big programs |
| Spyder | Anaconda IDE with interactive debugger |
| IDLE | default basic Python editor |
| IPython | powerful interactive environment |
| Jupyter | great for integrating output, text and diagrams |
| JupyterLab | like Jupyter but slightly different interface |
| Notepad++ | good general-purpose text editor on Windows |
| Vim | works through SSH and other terminals |

----

## VS Code

A modern general-purpose text editor. There are many plugins for Python and other languages available. It has great integration for git and Docker.

----

## PyCharm

PyCharm is probably the most luxurious IDE for Python. It contains tons of functions that cover most of what the other editors offer. This makes PyCharm a great choice for bigger Python projects, although it has a bit of a learning curve.

----

## Spyder

**Spyder** is part of the **Anaconda** Python distribution. It is a small IDE mostly for data analysis, similar to RStudio. It automatically highlights Syntax errors, contains a variable explorer, debugging functionality and other useful things.

----

## IDLE

The standard editor distributed with Python. IDLE is easy to use but very basic.
IDLE is not useful for bigger programs.

----

## IPython

IPython is a better interactive Python command line. It incorporates tab-completion, interactive help and running regular shell commands.

IPython adds `%`-magic commands like `%time` and `%hist` that are available in most of the other editors. This is why you find IPython listed here.

IPython is very useful to try out a few lines of code quickly, but it does not really count as an editor.

----

## Jupyter and Jupyter Lab

Interactive environment for the web browser. A Jupyter notebook contains Python code, text, images and any output from your program (including plots!). It is a great tool for exploratory data analysis.

Jupyter Lab offers a slightly different interface, but does the same things under the hood.

----

## Notepad++

If you must use a text editor on Windows to edit files, use **Notepad++**. **DO NOT USE THE WINDOWS NOTEPAD!**

----

## Vim

To use Vim, you need to learn a lot of keyboard shortcuts. Its unique advantage is that it is the only editor in this collection that you can use through an SSH connection on a remote machine.
