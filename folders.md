# Create a Folder Structure

A small but important part of a project is creating folders for your code.
In the Python world, there is a standard structure that you will find in many other projects.
The next few steps let you create one.

### Step 1: A package folder

First, you need a place for the package you want to write.
A **Python package** is simply a folder that contains `.py` files.
Create a folder `snake` inside your repository.
On the bash terminal, you would use

    mkdir snake

If your git repository is also called `snake`, you may want to rename your project folder to something else like `snake_project`, `snake_repo` or similar.
If you have two folders calles `snake` inside each other could lead to strange import bugs later

----

### Step 2: A folder for tests

You will also want to have a place where you add test code later.
Name that folder `tests/`.
We will leave it empty for now.

    mkdir tests

----

### Step 3: Create a Python module

You may want to create a Python module (a `.py` file) to make sure everything is set up correctly.
Create a file `game.py` inside the `snake/` folder.
Add a placeholder function to it:

    def play_snake():
        print('this is a snake game')

Now start Python in your main project folder (above the package) through the terminal.
**It is important that you start Python in your project folder. It will probably not work from your IDE at this point.**
The code that you want to get running is:

    from snake.game import play_snake

    play_snake()

You should see the message from the print statement.

----

### Step 4: main Python file

Importing the `play_snake()` function to play the game is a bit inconvenient.
Let's create a shortcut.
Create a file named `__main__.py` (with double underscores on both ends) in the package folder that contains the following code:

    from game import play_snake
    
    play_snake()

Now it should be possible to start the game by typing:

    python snake

----

### Summary

At this point, your project folder should contain:

    LICENSE
    prototype.py
    README.md
    snake/
        game.py
        __main__.py
    tests/
