Python Software Development
===========================

What this guide is about?
-------------------------

This guide is for you if you are writing programs with more than 500
lines.

You know how to write Python code, but have realized that creating a
piece of software is more complex. You are facing questions like:

-  How to clean up my code?
-  How to make sure my program works?
-  How to install my program on multiple computers?
-  How to keep the program running over time?
-  How to deliver the program to other people?

Below you find development tools and techniques that help you to write
programs that get the job done and don’t fall apart.
