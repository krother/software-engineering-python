# Installing Packages with pip

`pip` is a tool to install Python packages and resolve dependencies automatically. This section lists a couple of things you can do with `pip`:

### Install a package

To install a Python package, call `pip` with the package name:

    pip install pandas

You can specify the exact version of a package:

    pip install pandas==0.25.0

----

### Install many packages

First, create a file `requirements.txt` in your project directory. The file should look similar to this:

    pandas==0.25
    numpy>=1.17
    scikit-learn
    requests

Second, ask `pip` to install everything:

    pip -r requirements.txt

----

### Install from a git repo

If a repository has a `setup.py` file, you could install directly from git. This is useful to install branches, forks and other work in progress:

    pip install git+https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas.git

----

### Install a package you are developing

When developing, you might want to pip-install a working copy. This allows you to import your package (e.g. for testing). Changes to the code directly take effect in the installation.

For the following to work, your project folder needs to have a `setup.py`:

    pip install --editable .

----

### List all installed packages

This one prints all packages you have installed and their versions:

    pip freeze

To search for a pacakge, use `grep`:

    pip freeze | grep pandas

----
### Uninstall a package

`pip` also removes packages:

    pip uninstall pandas

----

### Where does pip store its files?

Usually, packages are stored in the `site_packages/` folder. Where this one is depends on your distribution and your virtual environment.

You might want to check your `PYTHONPATH` environment variable. To do so from Python, use:

    import sys
    print(sys.path)

----

* The `conda` program (part of the Anaconda distribution) is often a viable alternative to pip
* You find all installable packages on the [Python Package Index pypi.org](http://pypi.org)
