# Create a pip-installable Package

Once a python package (a folder with `.py` files), you may want to make it available to other programs â€“ and people.
Making your code pip-installable can be done by adding an extra configuration files called `setup.py`.

Assume your project folder contains:

    :::text
    super_snake/   - module folder you want to import
    tests/         - the test code for pytest
    .git/          - the commit history (managed by git)
    README.md      - documentation
    LICENSE        - legal info
    setup.py       - used by pip (see below)
    .gitignore     - choose one on Github


## The Project Folder

Your project folder should contain a sub-directory with a name in **lowercase_with_underscores**.
This sub-directory is your python package!
Add your own Python files inside this package folder.
The `setup.py` script will look for the source code there.


## The setup.py file

**setuptools** is a Python library that builds and installs Python packages.
You may need to install it first:

    :::bash
    pip install setuptools

In order to use setuptools, you need a file called `setup.py` that tells the installer what to install.
You can use the following `setup.py` file as a starting point:

    :::python3 

    from setuptools import setup
    import os

    def get_readme():
        """returns the contents of the README file"""
        return open(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), "README.md")).read()

    setup(
       name="super_snake",                       # snake is already taken on PyPi
       version="0.0.1",                          # uses *semantic versioning*
       description="a terminal-based snake game",   
       long_description=get_readme(),
       author="your_name",
       author_email="your@name.com",
       packages=["super_snake"],                 # the name of the folder with .py modules
       url="https://github.com/...",
       license="MIT",
       classifiers=[
          "Programming Language :: Python :: 3.8",
       ]
    )

Copy this code to a `setup.py` file in the top-level folder of your project and save it.

Here is a [video explaining how setup.py works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Le3PWHqZA).

## Install your program

When developing a program, the first thing you want to do is to install your program in development mode.
Go to the folder where the ``setup.py`` file is located and run the command:

    :::bash
    python setup.py develop

    OR

    pip install --editable .

This makes your project available to the rest of your Python environment
(Python creates a link to your project somewhere in the PYTHONPATH).
Now you should be able to run from any other Python program:

    :::python3
    import super_snake

In other words, you don't actually need to be in your project folder to use your program.
This is super convenient! You can use your package from anywhere as if it were an official library, like **pandas** or **sklearn**.
You should also see your package in the output of ``pip list`` or ``pip freeze``.

This method has the advantage that you can still edit your code, and the next time you import the library again.

**WARNING:** for the re-import to work, you need to restart the Python interpreter.
Just executing the import twice does not work.

----

## Installation on other machines

If you want to use your library but not edit it (e.g. in a production environment), you may want to copy it to where Python stores all the other packages.
This can be done with another one-liner.

    :::bash
    python setup.py install

    OR

    pip install .

The files are copied to a folder called `site-packages/` .
The location of it depends on your operating system and Python distribution. 

----

## Installation from GitHub

If you have a `setup.py`, you can pip-install your package directly from GitHub:

    :::bash
    pip install <github-url>
   
----

## Creating a distribution

If you want to package all files of your projects into an archive, you can do this with:

    :::bash
    python setup.py sdist

This creates a `dist/` folder with a `.tar.gz` file that you can move around easily.

----

## Further Reading

If you would like to upload your program to PyPi, so that anyone can install it with 

    :::bash
    pip install super_snake

you need to follow a few more steps.
This is not difficult but a bit tedious.
We recommend the official `Packaging Python Projects Tutorial <https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/>`__.
