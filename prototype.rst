The Prototype
=============

Before attempting a more costly clean implementation, you may want to
check whether the project is feasible at all. You can do such a check by
implementing a quick and dirty proof of concept: a **prototype**. The
goal of a prototype is usually to reduce risks in a project.

A prototype can answer questions like:

-  is my programming environment set up properly?
-  can we solve a particular algorithmic problem?
-  does a library do what we need?
-  is the algorithm/library fast enough?
-  what safety/security risks are there?
-  did we understand the customer correctly?

A Prototype for a Snake game
----------------------------

Let's look at a prototype for a Snake game.
The program is a simple game where you move a symbol around with the ``WASD`` keys.
The goal of this prototype is to prove that you can process keyboard input
and draw 2D graphics in a terminal.

The prototype helps us to get rid of installation and environment issues right away.

Exercise 1: Save the code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Save the code in :download:`snake_prototype.py <snake_prototype.py>` to a Python file.

Exercise 2: Windows installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On Windows, you need to install ``windows-curses``:

::

   pip install windows-curses

Exercise 3: Execute the prototype
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Change to the directory with the ``.py`` file and execute the code with:

::

   python prototype.py

You should see a screen where you can control the ``'O'`` with the keys **W, A, S and D**:

.. figure:: images/prototype.png
   :alt: prototype output

   prototype output

Exercise 4: Code Review
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Inspect the Python file. Take notes to answer the following questions:

* What do you like about the code?
* What do you not like about the code?
* What would you like to know more about?

Reflection Questions
--------------------

Discuss the following questions:

-  Can you think of a software project with special risks?
-  Could these risks be mitigated by writing a prototype?
-  Do you know other engineering disciplines where prototypes are used?
