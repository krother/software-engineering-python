# Writing a big Program

1.  List all kinds of things that a user wants to do with the program (Use Cases).
2.  Think of a smart representation of your data.
3.  Create classes containing the data, and create a diagram containing all classes.
4.  Determine which other modules your program will require.
5.  Write a flowchart for complex tasks/algorithms.
6.  For all Use Cases, create simple example data, and write a test function.
7.  Only after 1.-6., start writing the program.
8.  When all tests work, stop immediately programming and start testing.
9.  Every time you find a bug, write a new test.
