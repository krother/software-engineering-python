# User Stories

## What are User Stories?

No written goals are a recipe for disaster. On the other hand, a detailed description is often not practical. User Stories are a short written form for project tasks that fits on an index card.

User stories are also called **"a promise of communication"**

## What are User Stories good for?

1. Formalize what a customer wants.
2. Mark roles and responsibilities.
3. Document a technical solution.
4. Document estimates.
5. Track completion status.
6. Make it easier to discuss the details later


## How to decompose Stories?

Right size:

* smallest possible action that a user can do
* smallest piece with business value.
* Tasks: no more than two person-days.

## How to write User Stories?

* Title + 2-3 sentences.
* Clear benefit for user.
* No technical description.
* Write stories on A6 cards, trash them if it doesn't fit.
* Use the pattern **"As a X, I want to Y, so that Z."**

## Example User Story

    As a teacher, I want to write grades into a table, so I don't need to write them down manually.

## Other points

* keep User Stories in backlogs, on SCRUM/Kanban boards.
* keep User Stories in electronic ticket systems (Trac, Pivotal).
* User Stories versus Tasks (in Scrum).
