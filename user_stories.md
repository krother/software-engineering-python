# User Stories

Writing down goals increases the probability that you will reach them.
On one hand, written goals help to focus work both on your own and in a team.
On the other hand, a writing down everything in detail is often not practical.
**User Stories** are a short written form for project tasks.


## How to write User Stories?

A User Story has to fit on an index card.
It should contain:

* a title
* a clear benefit for users
* no technical detail
* optionally 2-3 criteria for success

Many developers use the pattern **"As a X, I want to Y, so that Z."**
Here is an example User Story for the Snake game:

    :::text
    As a player,
    I want to eat food with my snake,
    so that it grows.


## What are User Stories good for?

User Stories help with a couple of things:

1. formalize what a customer wants
2. mark who is working on a story
3. estimate the work required
4. track completion status (as GitHub issues, a Kanban board or JIRA)
5. discuss the details later (they are also called *"Promise of Communication"*)


## Decomposing Stories

Often, a project starts with a few big User Stories (also called Epics).
These are later decomposed into smaller working units.
A good size in a development project is 1-2 work days. 
Finding the right size may take several rounds of decomposing.

## Exercise

Write down 3 User Stories for the Snake game.
Use the format

    :::text
    As a <who?>, I want to <what?>, so that <why?>.
