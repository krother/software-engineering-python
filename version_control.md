# Set up a Git Repository

Version Control is in my opinion the single most important tool of modern software development.
Most of the time, using Version Control means using **git**.
In this recipe, you will set up your own project repository on [GitHub](https://www.github.com).

I won't be describing here what git is or how to use it.
There are lots of high quality tutorials for it.
If you have never used git before or need a refresher, check out the [Introduction to Git and GitHub](https://realpython.com/python-git-github-intro/) by Jim Anderson.

Let's go through the steps setting git/GitHub for your project:

### Step 1: Create a repository

There are two ways to create a new repository: 

1. using the GitHub website
2. using `git init` in the terminal

I recommend starting on GitHub, because you can create a couple of useful files there right away.

Log in to your account on [github.com](https://www.github.com) (or create one if you are there for the first time).
Then, find the **button with a big plus (+)** in the top right corner and select **New Repository**.
You should see a dialog where you can enter the name and description of your project:

![create a repository](images/create_repo.png)

I recommend you use names in `lowercase_with_underscores`. This may avoid random bugs on some operating systems.

### Step 2: Decide whether your project is public

When you scroll down the creation dialog, there are several control boxes.
The first one selects whether your project is visible to the rest of the world.
There is a simple guideline:

* If your project is work for a company or you feel you want to keep it confidential, choose **Private**.
* If you would like to share it, choose **Public**.

It is fine to have public projects that are *incomplete*, *simple* or *not practically useful*.
Having a simple project that is cleaned up well may be a good advertisement.
The Private/Public setting is easy to change later on as well.

### Step 3: Add a README file

This is a no-brainer. Tick this box.

### Step 4: Add a .gitignore

The `.gitignore` file prevents that many types of temporary or auto-generated files are added to your repository.
It is another must-have.
Choose **Python** from the dialog.

### Step 5: Choose a license

GitHub offers a selection of time-tested open-source licenses.
They are legally watertight, but differ in subtle aspects.
For a hobby project, I recommend the **MIT License**.
It roughly says:

* other people may use your code for whatever they want
* they have to keep the MIT License in
* you cannot be held legally liable

If you find out later that you need a different license, you as the author are allowed to change it.

### Step 6: Create the repo

Now you are ready to go.
The dialog should look similar to this:

![Git setup dialog](images/git_dialog.png)

Press the **Create Repository** button.
After a few seconds, you should see a page listing the files in your new project repo:

    :::text
    .gitignore
    LICENSE
    README.md


### Step 7: Clone the repository

Next, create a local working copy of your project.
For that, you need to **clone** the repository.
You need to have git installed on your computer.
You find a [git installation guide on git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).

To clone the repository, you need the address under the big button labeled **Code**:

![Copy the URL](images/git_url.png)

Do the following:

1. Copy the address starting with `git@github..` from the GitHub page
2. Open a terminal on your computer
3. Use `cd` to navigate to the folder where you keep your projects
4. Type `git clone` followed by the address you just copied 

You should see a message similar to:

    :::text
    kristian@kristianspiced:~/projects$ git clone git@github.com:krother/snake.git
    Cloning into 'snake'...
    remote: Enumerating objects: 5, done.
    remote: Counting objects: 100% (5/5), done.
    remote: Compressing objects: 100% (4/4), done.
    Receiving objects: 100% (5/5), done.
    remote: Total 5 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0

There also should be a new folder:

    :::text
    kristian@kristianspiced:~/projects$ ls -la snake
    total 24
    drwxrwxr-x  3 kristian kristian 4096 Mai 28 11:33 .
    drwxrwxr-x 50 kristian kristian 4096 Mai 28 11:33 ..
    drwxrwxr-x  8 kristian kristian 4096 Mai 28 11:33 .git
    -rw-rw-r--  1 kristian kristian 1799 Mai 28 11:33 .gitignore
    -rw-rw-r--  1 kristian kristian 1072 Mai 28 11:33 LICENSE
    -rw-rw-r--  1 kristian kristian   35 Mai 28 11:33 README.md


### Step 8: Add your code

Now you can start adding code to your repository.
For instance you could add a prototype if you have one.
The sequence of commands might look like this:

    :::bash
    cd snake/
    cp ~/Desktop/prototype.py .
    git status
    git add prototype.py 
    git commit -m "add a snake prototype"
    git push

To exectute `git push`, you may need to [Add SSH keys to your GitHub account](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account/).

In the end, you should see the code of your prototype on your GitHub page.
**Congratulations!**
