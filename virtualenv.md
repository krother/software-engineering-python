# Virtual Environments

When developing software, you often need a specific combination of Python libraries. Sometimes this is difficult, because you require a specific version of a library, want to test your program on multiple Python versions, or simply need to develop your program further, while a stable version is installed on the same machine. In these cases, **virtual environments** come to the rescue.

## What is a virtual environment?

A virtual environment manages multiple parallel installations of Python interpreters and libraries, so that you can switch between them.
The virtual environment consists of a folder per project, in which Python libraries for that project are installed.

----

## How to install a virtual environment?

There are many Python tools to manage virtual environments: venv, virtualenv, Pipenv and Poetry.
A beginner-friendly tool is to use **conda**.
If you haven't installed Anaconda already, you can find the **Miniconda installer** at [https://conda.io/miniconda.html](https://conda.io/miniconda.html).

## How to set up a project with conda?

Once the installer finishes and you open a new terminal, you should see `(base)` before the prompt:

    (base) ada@adas_laptop:~$

This means you are in an virtual environment called *"base"*.

Let's create a new one for a project called **snake**, specifying a Python version:

    conda create -n snake python=3.11

Behind the scenes **conda** creates a new subdirectory.
This is where libraries for your project will be stored.
There are also scripts to activate the environment.

## How to work with an environment

To start working with your project, type:

    conda activate snake

You should see a *(snake)* appearing at your prompt.
Now, whenever you use *pip* to install something, it will be installed only for *myproject*.

Now check which libraries you have installed:

    pip freeze

You can install additional libraries with `pip` or `conda`:

    conda install pandas

When you want to switch back to the base environment, type:

    conda activate base

The virtual environment is specific for a terminal session. Thus, you can work on as many projects simultaneously as you have terminals open.
